# Radix-Calculator-Converter
this project is the converter of different numbers belongs to different radix systems.the basic radix systems are decimal which is used by the world.binary number system which is used by the computer arithmetic and functioning.
the basic radix systems are:
1,the decimal number system which is widely used by the people .
2,binary number system which is used by the computer internal system for arithmetic and other proccesses.
3,the number systems are octal and hexadecimal number systems
these are basic systems there are several number systems are possible but the problem is to find and represent the different symbols for the number .
every number system which is base "N" contains N-1 different digits to represent a number in that system.
but this project capable to convert the 2 to 36 base radix systems numbers to other.
